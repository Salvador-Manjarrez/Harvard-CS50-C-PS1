# Harvard-CS50-C-PS1
This is Harvard's CS50 first problem set. In this program written in C language, we take the total amount of money in cents that we owe to a imaginary client, we then store the value and define four variables for quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. The program efficently gives back the cents owed with the lesser amount of coins possible.
